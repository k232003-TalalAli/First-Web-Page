         <h2>Life in Gaza</h2>
         <img src="imges/nocon.png" alt="Palestinian Orphans crying" class="no-hover-effect">
         <p >The hundreds of Israeli military closures across the West Bank such as checkpoints, roadblocks and settler-only roads, as well as the
          overall permit regime, make simple daily tasks for Palestinians who are trying to get to work, school or hospital a constant struggle. 
          Israel claims the winding 700-km fence/wall is there to prevent armed attacks on Israel by Palestinians. But that does not explain why 85%
           of it is built on Palestinian land, including land deep inside the West Bank. What the fence/wall does is cut off Palestinian communities 
           from each other and rip families apart. It also deprives Palestinians from accessing essential services and separates farmers from their 
           land and other resources, crippling the Palestinian economy. Inherently discriminatory and unjust laws also prevent many people from being 
           able to marry, or travel within the occupied territories or into Israel to visit or live with their loved ones. These arbitrary restrictions
            are discriminatory and unlawful and must be lifted immediately. <br><br>
         "Israel is under an obligation to return the land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable property seized in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
         All States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation thus resulting.  -International Court of Justice <br><br> 
          Israel's sweeping restrictions on leaving Gaza deprive its more than two million residents of opportunities
          to better their lives, Human Rights Watch said today on the fifteenth anniversary of the 2007 closure. The closure has devastated the economy in 
          Gaza, contributed to fragmentation of the Palestinian people, and forms part of Israeli authorities' crimes against humanity of apartheid and 
          persecution against millions of Palestinians. Israel's closure policy blocks most Gaza residents from going to the West Bank, preventing professionals,
           artists, athletes, students, and others from pursuing opportunities within Palestine and from traveling abroad via Israel, restricting their rights to 
           work and an education. Restrictive Egyptian policies at its Rafah crossing with Gaza, including unnecessary delays and mistreatment of travelers, have 
           exacerbated the closure's harm to human rights. “Israel, with Egypt's help, has turned Gaza into an open-air prison,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine 
           director at Human Rights Watch. “As many people around the world are once again traveling two years after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, Gaza's more than 
           two million Palestinians remain under what amounts to a 15-year-old lockdown.” Israel should end its generalized ban on travel for Gaza residents and permit 
           free movement of people to and from Gaza, subject to, at most, individual screening and physical searches for security purposes.</p>

            <h2>Western Coverage of Palestine</h2>
               <p>Publishing unsubstantiated claims, telling only one side of the story, and painting  Palestinians as nothing more than objects in Hamas's hands are all unprofessional
                 mistakes Western media makes while covering the conflict between Israel and Hamas, media experts and Arab journalists say. Experts and journalists who spoke to Al Jazeera 
                 said the systemic “bias in favour of Israel” is “irreparably damaging” the credibility of news agencies considered “mainstream” in the eyes of Arabs and others.
                As Western media organisations “dehumanise Palestinians” and “legitimise Israeli violations of international law” as Israel bombs Gaza, it is glaringly obvious that the vital 
                historical context of the trauma Palestinians have been through for the past 75 years is being left out, experts say. On October 7, Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on 
                military outposts and communities in southern Israel, killing more than 1,400 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli officials.
                The same day, Israel launched a relentless bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 8,000 people, about 40 percent of whom are children. It also devastated Gaza's health sector
                 and flattened much of its infrastructure while strengthening its choke-hold siege by cutting off fuel, water and food, acts that may amount to war crimes under international humanitarian law.
                United Nations experts say Palestinians in Gaza are facing the risk of genocide <br><br>
                Western correspondents have gone to Israel where they reported extensively on the grief of Israeli families, but Israel has not allowed foreign journalists to enter Gaza, which means
                 they're missing a vital aspect of the story. “If you don't live in Gaza, if you don't listen to the prayers Palestinians make when they lose loved ones, if you don,t learn about the 
                 life story of loved ones [who have been killed] …then the coverage [of Gaza] won't be the same [as the coverage of Israel],” Taghreed El-Khodary, an analyst from Gaza, told Al Jazeera 
                 from her home in the Netherlands. This means, she continued, that they “are not just covering the Israeli narrative, but they are living the Israeli narrative”</p>
