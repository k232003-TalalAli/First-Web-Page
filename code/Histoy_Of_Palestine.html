         <h2>Ancient History</h2>
           <p >The region of Palestine was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities and civilization. In the Bronze Age, the Canaanites established independent city-states
               that were influenced by the surrounding civilizations, among them Egypt, which ruled the area in the Late Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, two related Israelite kingdoms, Israel and Judah,
               controlled much of Palestine, while the Philistines occupied its southern coast. The Assyrians conquered the region in the 8th century BCE, then the Babylonians in c. 601 BCE, followed by the
               Persians who conquered the Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE. Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire in the late 330s BCE, beginning a long  period of Hellenization in the region. In the 
               late 2nd century BCE, the Hasmonean Kingdom conquered most of Palestine and parts of neighbor ingregions but the kingdom gradually became a vassal of Rome, which annexed the area in 63 BCE.  
               Roman Judea was troubled by large-scale Jewish revolts, which Rome answered with by destroying Jerusalem and the Second Jewish Temple.In the 4th century, as the Roman Empire christened, Palestine 
               became a center of Christianity,  attracting pilgrims, monks and scholars. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 636-641, several Muslim ruling dynasties succeeded each other as they wrestled 
               control of Palestine: the Rashiduns; the Umayyads, who built the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem; the Abbasids; the semi-independent Tulunids and the Ikhshidids; 
               the Fatimids; and the Seljuks. In 1099, the Crusaders established the Kingdom of Jerusalem in Palestine, which the Ayyubid Sultanate reconquered in 1187.</p>

            <h2>Medieval History</h2>
               <p >Following the invasion of the Mongol Empire, the Egyptian Mamluks reunified Palestine under its control before the Ottoman Empire conquered the region in 1516 and ruled it as Ottoman Syria largely undisrupted through to the 20th century.
               During World War I the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, favoring the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. The British captured Palestine from the 
               Ottomans shortly thereafter. The League of Nations unfairly gave Britain mandatory power over Palestine in 1922. British colonial rule and Arab efforts to prevent Jewish migration into Palestine led to growing
               sectarian violence between Arabs and Jews, eventually causing the British government to announce its intention to terminate the Mandate in 1947. The United Nations General Assembly recommended 
               partitioning Palestine into two states; one Arab and one Jewish. However, the situation in Palestine had deteriorated into a civil war between Arabs and Jews. THe palestinians who were living in these areas
               for centuries had been ordered to leave their homes and to "share" the lind with the new coming jews from Europe. Hence the Arabs rejected the Partition Plan, but to no one's surprise,
               the Jews ostensibly accepted it, declaring the independence of the State of Israel in May 1948 upon the termination of the British mandate. Nearby Arab countries invaded Palestine, but Israel, thankls to the US 
               prevailed and also annexed far more territory of the Mandate than envisioned by the Partition Plan. During the war, 700,000, or about 80% of all Palestinians fled or were driven out of the territory 
               that Israel conquered, and were not allowed to return, this event tbecame known as the Nakba ("Catastrophe") to the Palestinians. Starting in the late 1940s and continuing for decades thereafter, 
                about 850,000 Jews from the Arab world immigrated ("made Aliyah") to Israel. </p>

            <h2>Post War History</h2>
                <p > After the war, only two parts of Palestine remained in Arab control: the West Bank (and East-Jerusalem), annexed by Jordan, and the Gaza Strip (occupied by Egypt), which were conquered by Israel 
                during the Six-Day War in 1967. Despite international objections, Israel started to establish settlements in these occupied territories.[1] Meanwhile, the Palestinian national movement gradually 
                gained international recognition, largely thanks to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO, founded in 1965) under the leadership of Yasser Arafat. In 1993, the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel
                and the PLO established the Palestinian National Authority (PA) as an interim body to run parts of Gaza and the West Bank (but not East Jerusalem) pending a permanent solution to the conflict. Further
                peace developments were not ratified and/or implemented, and in recent history, relations between Israel and Palestinians have been marked by repeated military conflicts, especially with the Islamist 
                group Hamas, which also rejects the PA. In 2007, Hamas won control of Gaza from the PA, now limited to the West Bank. In November 2012, the State of Palestine (the name used by the PA) became a non-member
                observer state in the UN, allowing it to take part in General Assembly debates and improving its chances of joining other UN agencies. In 2017 however, President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and, 
                on 14 May 2018, the United States moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This Support from the US incited the Zionists who realized that as long as they are backed up by the US, they can effectively
                invade or 'claim' Palestinian lands without any reprecursions by the UNO. Hence Israel began to Openly Invade Palestine and since then has repeatedly killed and displaced many Palestinians with little to
              no effective backclash by the International Community</p>
