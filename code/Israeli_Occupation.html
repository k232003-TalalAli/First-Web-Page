         <h2>Dispossession Of Palestinians</h2>
           <p >For half a century, Israel's occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip has resulted in systematic human rights violations against Palestinians living there.
            Since the occupation first began in June 1967, Israel's ruthless policies of land confiscation, illegal settlement and dispossession, coupled with rampant discrimination, have inflicted immense 
            suffering on Palestinians, depriving them of their basic rights.Israel's military rule disrupts every aspect of daily life in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. It continues to affect whether,
           when and how Palestinians can travel to work or school, go abroad, visit their relatives, earn a living, attend a protest, access their farmland, or even access electricity or a clean water supply. 
           It means daily humiliation, fear and oppression. People's entire lives are effectively held hostage by Israel. Israel has also adopted a complex web of military laws to crush dissent against its
            policies, and senior government officials have branded Israelis advocating for Palestinian rights as “traitors”.For the last 50 years, Israel has been forcing thousands of Palestinians off their land, 
            occupying and illegally using it to create settlements that exclusively house Jewish Israeli settlers. Entire Palestinian communities have been displaced by these settlements. Their homes and livelihoods
             have been destroyed, they've had restrictions enforced on their movement, access to their own water, land and other natural resources. The communities have also been violently attacked by the Israeli 
             military and settlers. The issue is not just about Israel taking Palestinian land and resources illegally. Governments around the world are letting goods produced in these settlements into their markets,
              and are allowing companies in their countries to operate in settlements. All of this helps the illegal settlements profit and thrive. It is up to us now to ban Israeli settlement goods from entering our
               markets, and to stop companies based in your country operating in settlements or trading in their goods and help put an end to the cycle of violations suffered by Palestinians living under Israel's occupation.</p> <br><br>

            <h2>Illegal Israeli settlements</h2>
               <p >Israel's policy of constructing and expanding illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian land is one of the main driving forces behind the mass human rights violations resulting from the occupation.
                 Over the past 50 years, Israel has demolished tens of thousands of Palestinian properties and displaced large swathes of the population to build homes and infrastructure to illegally settle its own 
                 population in the occupied territories. It has also diverted Palestinian natural resources such as water and agricultural land for settlement use.The very existence of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
                 Territories violates international humanitarian law and is a war crime. Despite multiple UN resolutions, Israel has continued to appropriate Palestinian land and support at least 600,000 settlers living in the 
                 occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Until 2005, more than 9,000 Israeli settlers were illegally residing in Gaza.In recent months, Israel has accelerated settlement expansion. The government has announced 
                 plans for thousands of new homes in existing settlements, as well as the establishment of two new settlements in the occupied West Bank. As well as illegally building settlement homes and infrastructure on Palestinian land
                 , Israeli and international businesses in settlements have established a thriving economy to sustain their presence and expansion. This “settlement enterprise” relies on unlawfully appropriated Palestinian resources,
                  including land, water and minerals, to produce goods that are exported and sold for private profit. Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of settlement goods are exported internationally each year.
                THe CUrrent Israeli president: Netenyahu and his far-right government has approved plans to build thousands of new homes in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, in a move that a Palestinian 
                official decried as a part of an open war against the Palestinian people. “The Netanyahu government is moving forward with its aggression and open war against the Palestinian people,” said Wasel Abu Yousef, a Palestinian
                 official in the occupied West Bank. “We affirm that all settler colonialism in all the occupied Palestinian territories is illegitimate and illegal.” Senior members of the Israeli government have been pushing for increased 
                 construction and other measures to cement Israel's control over the territory in response to a more than year-long wave of violence with the Palestinians.</p>

            <h2>Invasion of 2023</h2>
                <p >Hammas: Pelestinian Freedom fighting organization has consitently resisted these illegal settlement of Israel. Whenever Israels Hostility
                  towards the Civilians of Gaza has increased, Hammas has been quick to retaliate. In Oct of 2023, Israel attacked Al aqsa mosque and harrassed the people
                  praying in the most, Hammas in retaliation, launched a rocket at an Israeli concert, killing 160 Israeli. Israel as a result declared war on Palestine, a war
                  which is still continuing till this day and "would not end till Hammas is taken down" According to Israeli Deffence Minister. In just a span of days, The Israeli army
                   has destroyed much of the vital utilities and structures of the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza before leaving the compound on Friday after 10 days of occupation.The Israeli
                    army destroyed buildings and power generators, as well as vital medical equipment like oxygen pumps and medical devices, before leaving the compound, which had served
                    as the primary medical facility for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, local sources told Anadolu.The Israeli army had occupied Al-Shifa Hospital for 10 days, driving out patients,
                     injured, doctors, paramedics, other staff members, and ordinary civilians seeking safety from the escalating attacks on Gaza. The Israeli army also blew up many of  the
                      hospital's departments and buildings, the sources added.The four-day humanitarian pause between the Israeli army and Palestinian group Hamas came into effect on Friday 
                       morning in all areas of the Gaza Strip, temporarily stopping attacks in exchange for prisoners and aid. Israel has launched relentless air and ground attacks in the Gaza 
                       Strip following the Hamas attack, killing at least 14,854 Palestinians, including 6,150 children and over 4,000 women, according to health authorities in the enclave. <br><br>
                       The Israeli military's repeated, apparently unlawful attacks on medical facilities, personnel, and transport are further destroying the Gaza Strip's healthcare system and 
                       should be investigated as war crimes, Human Rights Watch said today. Despite the Israeli military's claims on November 5, 2023, of “Hamas's cynical use of hospitals,” no 
                       evidence put forward would justify depriving hospitals and ambulances of their protected status under international humanitarian law.The World Health Organization (WHO)
                        has reported that at least 521 people, including 16 medical workers, have been killed in 137 “attacks on health care” in Gaza as of November 12. These attacks, alongside
                         Israel's decisions to cut off electricity and water and block humanitarian aid to Gaza, have severely impeded health care access. The United Nations found as of November 
                         10 that two-thirds of primary care facilities and half of all hospitals in Gaza are not functioning at a time when medical personnel are dealing with unprecedented numbers
                          of severely injured patients. Hospitals have run out of medicine and basic equipment, and doctors told Human Rights Watch that they were forced to operate without anesthesia and 
                          to use vinegar as an antiseptic. <br><br> Israel's repeated attacks damaging hospitals and harming healthcare workers, already hard hit by an unlawful blockade, have devastated Gaza's
                           healthcare infrastructure,” said A. Kayum Ahmed, special adviser on the right to health at Human Rights Watch. “The strikes on hospitals have killed hundreds of people and put many
                            patients at grave risk because they're unable to receive proper medical care.” Human Rights Watch investigated attacks on or near the Indonesian Hospital, al-Ahli Hospital, the 
                            International Eye Care Center, the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, and the al-Quds Hospital between October 7 and November 7. Human Rights Watch spoke by phone with two 
                            displaced people sheltering in hospitals and 16 healthcare workers and hospital officials in Gaza and analyzed and verified open-source data, including videos posted to social media 
                            and satellite imagery, as well as WHO databases.Israeli forces struck the Indonesian Hospital multiple times between October 7 and October 28, killing at least two civilians.
                             The International Eye Care Center was struck repeatedly and completely destroyed after a strike on October 10 or 11. Strikes hit the compound and vicinity of the Turkish-Palestinian
                              Friendship Hospital on October 30 and 31. Damage to the hospital as well as a lack of fuel for hospital generators resulted in its closure on November 1. Repeated Israeli strikes 
                              damaged the al-Quds Hospital and injured a man and child out front. Israeli forces on several occasions struck well-marked ambulances, killing and wounding at least a dozen people 
                              in one incident on November 3, including children, outside al-Shifa hospital.</p>
