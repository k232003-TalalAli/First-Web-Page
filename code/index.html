          <h1> <u>STATE OF PALESTINE </u></h1>
        <p >Palestine (Arabic: فلسطين, romanized: Filasṭīne, officially the State of Palestine (دولة فلسطين, Dawlat Filasṭīn),
           is a state located in the Southern Levant region of West Asia. Founded on 15 November 1988 and officially governed by the
           Palestine Liberation Organization, it claims the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip as its territory,
           all of which has been Israeli-occupied territories since the 1967 Six-Day War. The West Bank contains 165 Palestinian enclaves 
           that are under Palestinian rule, but the remaining territories, including the 200 Israeli settlements, are under full Israeli control.  
           The Gaza Strip was governed by Egypt but conquered by Israel in 1967. Israel has governed the region until 2005 when
           Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election. The Gaza Strip has since been blockaded by Israel and Egypt.</p>

            <h3> <u>HISTORY OF PALESTINE</u></h3>
          <p >Palestine used to be under the sovereignty of the Othman Empire, until World War 1, When the British invaded, the Othman Empire was defeated and the British declared that they are working on
             the creation of a new Jewish state inside Palestine. According to the plan, Palestine would be divided into Gaza and the West Bank, and the rest of the land would go to the Jewish state of Israel.
             While the Jews readily accepted, this proposition was rejected by the Palestinians, which resulted in a civil war in the region but despite their efforts to defend their homeland, Israel was formed.
             Nearly a million Jews came to live in Israel and to make home for these new settlers,700,000, or about 80% of all Palestinians  were driven out of the territory that Israel had seized, and were not
             allowed to return, in an event that became known as the Nakba ("Catastrophe").This illegal settlements of Israelis Started in the late 1940s and is in practice in present day as well. </p> <br><br>

                <h3> <u>PEOPLE OF PALESTINE</u></h3>
              <p >Gaza residents call their home the world's largest open-air prison. Over 1.8 million people live here on just 365 square kilometers of land.
                  Two thirds of them are younger than 25. Israel often cuts off electricity water and gas to the region as winter closes in. Even when they have access to water, it is heavily polluted. Israel also
                  bombs hospitals and schools in Gaza claiming that there were terrorists hiding in them. The people of Gaza are not allowed to travel abroad as Israel rejects
                  their Visa as most Palestinians do not fall into their 'safety criteria'. Aside from Gaza, the West bank is also in complete control of Israel and it  continues
                to thousands of citizens out of their homes. Despite the Human Rights Organization heavily urging Israel to take care of innocent civilians and the UN issuing that
                Gaza had already became unlivable in 2020, Israel readily breaks international law, violates human rights of nearly 2.2 million people, yet faces little to no consequences 
              for doing so.</p>

                  <h3> <u>ISRAELI OCCUPATION</u></h3>
                <p >The West Bank has been under military occupation by Israel since 7 June 1967.
                  Israel has controversially, and in contravention of international law, established numerous Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank. The UN has consistently
                   reaffirmed that settlements in that territory are a "flagrant violation of international law".
                   Israel has been accused of major violations of international human rights law, including collective punishment and illegal occupation of Palestinian territories.
                   Palestinian civilians, mostly confined to scattered enclaves, are subject to martial law and are not permitted to vote in Israel's national elections.
                   This hypocritical and unjust system has caused Israel to be accused of committing apartheid, a charge that Israel rejects entirely. But despite these charges,
                   Israel continues to drive Palestinians out of their homes and illegally settling its own citizens there to claim the territory as its own.
